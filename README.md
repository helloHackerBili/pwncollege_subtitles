# ASU PwnCollege Subtitles Repository

Welcome to the ASU PwnCollege Subtitles Repository! This project aims to provide comprehensive bilingual subtitles (in both English and Chinese) for the educational videos produced by ASU PwnCollege. Our goal is to enhance accessibility for a wider audience, including non-native English speakers.

## About PwnCollege

PwnCollege is an initiative by Arizona State University (ASU) that offers hands-on learning experiences in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. The video content covers a variety of topics, from basic concepts to advanced techniques, making it an excellent resource for students and professionals alike.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find:
- SRT subtitle files containing both English and Chinese subtitles.

Additionally, I have uploaded the videos with bilingual subtitles to my Bilibili channel. You can check it out here: [My Bilibili Channel](https://space.bilibili.com/73800460/lists/4048783?type=season).

## Subtitle Advantages

Existing AI speech-to-text technologies still face issues with inaccurate punctuation and misrecognition of technical terms. To improve the accuracy and readability of the subtitles, the subtitles in this repository have been manually reviewed. While there may still be some imperfections, I hope these reviewed subtitles can help alleviate the burden for other language translators and those looking to optimize them.

## Contribution
