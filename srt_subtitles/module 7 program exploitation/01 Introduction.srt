00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,866
黑客们好，欢迎来到PWN学院
hello hackers welcome to pwn college

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:04,733
这是一个新模块的开始
this is the start of a new module

3
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:08,266
具体会讲述一些漏洞利用的场景
specifically a module on exploitation scenarios what I mean by that

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,300
会融合你在前5个模块所学
is putting together the building blocks that you have Learned so far in the previous 5 modules 

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:25,800
构建针对复杂目标的端到端攻击场景
into kind of end to end attacks against more complex targets  than you've seen thus far 

6
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:27,866
或者至少是一个复杂的组合漏洞场景
or  at least more complex combinations of vulnerabilities than you've seen thus far

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,133
怎么做呢?好吧
how to do that?  well

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,900
让我们先回忆一下我们在课程开始时学的
let's start by remembering what we Learned in the very beginning of the course

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,900
在介绍模块中介绍过的菲尼亚斯·费雪
 and the introduction module about Phineas Fisher

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,866
菲尼亚斯·费雪是个黑客
so Phineas Fisher was a hacker 

11
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:48,699
菲尼亚斯·费雪以图中的玩偶做为自己的形象
represented by this muppet who Phineas Fisher appeared as

12
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,966
接受vice杂志的采访
 on an interview with I think vice magazine

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,800
在此之前他们由于战胜了黑客团队出名
after their very famous hack against hacking team

14
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,899
菲尼亚斯·费希尔击败黑客团队
and Phineas Fisher compromised hacking team

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,833
使用了这些细致的步骤
in this meticulous step by step method 

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,400
首先他们进行了外部探索
1st they got they performed external reconnaissance

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,300
来了解他们面对的是什么
to understand what they're up against

18
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,999
然后他们在网络中获得立足点
they gain the foothold into the network 

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,300
使用了嵌入式设备上的一个漏洞
using kind of an entry vulnerability on an embedded device

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,400
然后他们对内网进行探索
they perform internal reconnaissance on the network 

21
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:28,099
他们逐渐在网络上获得影响力
and they step by step gain influence on the network 

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,500
持续不断地进行更多的探索
continually performing additional reconnaissance every step of the way 

23
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:35,899
直到打到完全胜利，然后双手插兜
until achieving total compromise and gloating about it

24
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,066
如果你不记得这个故事
if you don't remember this story

25
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:45,966
可以看一下介绍模块
take a look at the intro module I related there

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,100
这是一个非常有趣的端到端真实漏洞攻击的例子
a very interesting example of an end to end real vulnerability compromise

27
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,299
那么我们如何吸取这些教训
so how can we take these lessons 

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,100
并应用到这门课中呢？好吧
and apply it to this course. well

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,800
我们要像菲尼亚斯·费雪那样思考
we want to think like Phineas Fisher

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,766
我这么说并不是说去从事网络犯罪
and by this I don't mean go into a life of cyber crime

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,600
我在介绍模块中讨论了网络安全伦理
I discussed the ethics of cyber security in the intro module

32
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,299
回去复习一下
go back and review those

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,300
但菲尼亚斯·费雪和他们的例子确实介绍了
but Phineas Fisher and their example really introduces 

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,900
一个非常有趣的框架
a very interesting framework 

35
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,300
可以用来处理这些更复杂的场景
with which to approach these more complex expectation scenarios

36
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,500
我们来看看菲尼亚斯·费雪是怎么做的
so let's look through the steps that Phineas Fisher took

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,300
致使黑客团队被攻克
 to compromise hacking team and 

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,666
看看这些步骤如何应用到
see how those steps might apply

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,700
你们在这个模块中会遇到的各种类型的问题
to the types of problems that you will be facing in this module

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,700
步骤大致相同
the steps are roughly the same 

41
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,999
首先你拿到一个挑战题
1st you're given a challenge problem

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,900
先执行外部探索
perform external reconnaissance

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,100
然后用逆向工具,binary ninja、gidra之类的打开它
open it up in a reverse engineering tool and binary ninja gidra what have you

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,366
理解它是如何工作的
understand how it works 

45
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,366
运行它
run it

46
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:05,666
与之互动
interact with it

47
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:10,399
考虑哪些功能可能是脆弱的
consider what functionality might be vulnerable

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,100
当然，脆弱的功能是
and of course the functionality that's going to be vulnerable

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,100
肯定是你可以直接交互的
is going to be the functionality that you can interact with directly 

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,533
和你的输入有接触的
that your user input touches

51
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,799
它会处理你的用户输入等等
that processes your user input and so forth

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,800
一旦你找到了潜在的易受攻击的功能
then once you have an idea of potential vulnerable functionality

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,966
你要想利用它
you want to exploit it

54
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:33,366
先要找到最小的安全漏洞
find the smallest security hole

55
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,600
也许在输入处理过程有一个off by one问题
maybe there is an off by one error in a input processing routine

56
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,733
也许是栈缓冲区溢出
maybe there's a stack buffer overflow

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,000
也许在长度检查中存在有无符号问题
maybe there is a signedness error in a length check

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,400
找到最小的安全漏洞并加以利用
find that smallest security hole and exploit it

59
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,600
比如，溢出缓冲区，然后
overflow the buffer for example and then

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,366
进行内部调查
do the internal reconnaissance

61
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:08,100
停下来看看我的这一步取得了什么成就
stop and look at what did my single step achieve

62
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,933
我溢出了缓冲区
right I overflowed the buffer

63
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:15,499
我获得了什么额外的控制权
what have I achieved additional control over

64
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,600
下一步我还能做什么
what else can I do as the next step

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,500
我现在在程序中找到哪些其他漏洞
what other vulnerabilities have I now introduced into the program

66
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,700
可以让我
that might allow me to take

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,500
继续获得对程序状态的额外影响
continue to gain additional influence over the program state

68
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,733
当然，第四步是获得影响力
and then of course step 4 is gaining that influence

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,300
步骤4是继续使用
step 4 is continuing to use

70
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,900
你在程序中找到的其他缺点
the additional weaknesses that you have now introduced into the program

71
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,566
利用在漏洞上获得
by taking advantage of one vulnerability

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,700
的能力不断的构建组合
to continually chain and build on the capabilities

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,166
你，作为一个攻击者，在程序中拥有的能力
that you as  an attacker have within the program

74
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,933
当然光说是相当模糊的
of course this is fairly vague

75
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,300
而且情况会根据要攻击的程序不同而不同
uh very much depends on the programs you're trying to exploit

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,400
这个模块就是通过实践来学习
and this module will really be about learning through practice

77
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,866
但总的步骤是这样的
but the general steps are these right

78
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,800
第5步，在经过内部探索
of course step 5 after going through the internal reconnaissance

79
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,999
了解了你对程序有哪些控制
understanding what control you have over the program

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
了解了下一步你可以采取的措施
understanding what potential next steps you can take

81
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,733
最终，该程序将被彻底占领
eventually the program will be completely compromised

82
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,899
你攻击的计算机系统将会完全沦陷
 the computer system that you're attacking will be completely broken

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,700
然后你可以继续到第6步
and then you can move on to step 6

84
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,733
读取flag并提交
read out the flag and submit it

85
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,766
这是一门艺术
this is very much an art

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,200
对吧
right

87
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,400
你创造一个漏洞利用
you are creating an exploit 

88
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,599
你是在凭空创造功能
you're creating functionality out of thin air

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,600
创造起初程序中不存在的功能
functionality that did not exist in that program when you started

90
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,700
你们将在这些模块中看到的程序
the programs that you will be seeing in these modules

91
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,200
从未被设计为读取flag文件
 were never designed to read the flag file

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,800
从来没有被设计用来执行任意代码
were never designed to execute arbitrary code

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,400
他们只是想做一件非常小的事情
they were very much meant to do a very small thing

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,933
读入你的名字，说你好
read in your name and say hello

95
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:23,700
或在限制了打开文件功能的计算机里执行代码
or execute code in an esoteric computer architecture for which the opening of files has been disabled

96
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,166
诸如此类的事情
these sort of things and

97
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:27,999
你要让这些程序
you will have to take those programs

98
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,100
跟着你的指挥翩翩起舞
and you'll have to force them to dance to your own music

99
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,033
要做到这样。你要用到目前为止在这门课上学到的东西
you'll do that by putting together everything you've Learned in the course thus far

100
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:45,699
并将其组合应用以实现完全控制
 and applying it in tandem to achieve complete control

101
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,100
本模块接下来的视频
the rest of the videos in this module

102
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:56,100
我将通过几个非常具体的例子来说明这种情况
I'll go through a couple of very specific examples of these sort of situations

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,100
在练习题目中还有更多
and in the practice problems there will be significantly more

104
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:06,900
练习题目里的是这个模块的高价值内容
the practice problems is where the meat of this module will really come across um

105
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,566
这是我们在PWN学院尝试的一项新举措
this is a new thing that we're trying with pwn college

106
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,499
希望一切顺利
hopefully it works out great

107
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,566
并且
and

108
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,733
你能巩固迄今为止所学到的知识
you solidify the knowledge that you've gained thus far

109
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,300
接下来的视频再见
see you in the rest of the videos
